# Intrusion Detection System 

The internet has revolutionized access to information, enabling users to retrieve vast amounts of data effortlessly, transcending geographical and temporal barriers. This unprecedented connectivity has advanced research, education, and communication, but it has also created vulnerabilities that cybercriminals exploit to steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, and launch large-scale attacks. Consequently, robust security measures are essential to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of online data. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are crucial in defending against such threats, employing both signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods. While signature-based IDS are highly effective against known attacks, they struggle with novel, "zero-day" attacks. Conversely, anomaly-based IDS can detect unknown threats but often generate high false positive rates. A hybrid IDS, combining elements of both approaches, offers a more comprehensive defense. This study presents a new intrusion detection model utilizing deep learning, evaluated on the KDDâ€™99 and NSL-KDD datasets. The proposed model (IDDLE - Intrusion Detection Deep Learning Engine) incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques, including normalization, feature extraction, and categorical encoding. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. This research highlights the potential of deep learning in improving IDS performance, emphasizing the importance of continuous innovation and collaboration among security researchers, developers, and users to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats. The findings underscore the significance of advanced feature extraction and hybrid detection strategies in developing robust intrusion detection systems.
